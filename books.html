    <p class="bodytext">Hyapatia taught the people what she had learned (about Native Strength) and saw how helpful these teachings were to them. She realized this information needed to be shared with the public so she began writing these five books. (starting in 2016) </p>

  <p class="quoteboxtan"><span class="pro2"> Native Strength - The First Step On the Path To An Indomitable Life:</span>The First Step on the Path to an Indomitable Life is the first book in a series divulging a variety of Native American traditional methods for achieving and maintaining integrity, fortitude, will-power and control over one's life. By using tools revealed by our ancestors, we can choose how best to react to all that life has given us, thereby taking responsibility for our own emotional well-being. Pain is our first teacher and when we react properly it can stimulate us into emotional and intellectual growth. If we do not make proper adjustments, the pain will be perpetual and can even be compounded. We alone are responsible for the choices we make and that includes how we decide to react to the things that happen to us. We cannot change others any more than they can change us. Our happiness is in our own hands. These traditional teachings outline the path to that happiness. Teaching stories, medicine wheels and exercises guide the reader on a path to emotional strength where neither man nor nature can dominate the ability to find peace and happiness.</span>  </p>

<p class="quoteboxtan"><span class="pro2"> Stories Around the Wheel of Life:</span>  This book is the second in the Native Strength series. Native Strength – The First Step on the Path to an Indomitable Life, the first book in the series, gave the reader an introduction into the centuries-old inter-tribal system that gave rise to the stoic reputation of the Natives of North America. In 1986 I was introduced to this system and spent the next decades learning more by studying with medicine men and women across the United States, Canada, Australia and Hawaii. By following the path that these wise men and women have shared with me, we can act in positive ways that encourage growth and evolution in order to become wise in our later years and not become bitter people who never were able to fulfill their dreams and may now blame others for their situation in life. </span>

<p class="quoteboxtan"><span class="pro2"> Star People, Skinwalkers and Raven Mockers:</span> There has always been a connection between Native Americans and Star People. Almost every Native American tribe has a rich history of interaction with these beings. I will share with you what I have been taught about the Star People, Skin Walkers, Raven Mockers, the Crystal Skulls, Ten Magical Gifts we will acquire and the prophecies of things yet to come by the medicine men and women I studied with over the years. We will explore sound technology, “spooky action at a distance” in quantum physics and the ways the Star People are communicating with us now, including some very important and compelling crop circles.</span>  </p>

<p class="quoteboxtan"><span class="pro2"> Overcoming Bullies:</span>  It is not uncommon to find another person or situation has blocked our path to happiness. It is human nature to want to get our way. People who manipulate others subtly or with force can be called bullies. This includes what many may call toxic people. Overcoming Bullies identifies these people, puts them on the Wheel of Life in order to better understand them, and shows us ways we can stop being affected by them. When we fully understand why these people behave in the ways they do and what they are trying to accomplish we can effectively design a plan when we encounter them. </p>

<p class="quoteboxtan"><span class="pro2"> The Circles of Life:</span>  This book is a traditional Native American teaching that gives insight into our physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual abilities at any given time in our life. It is a reference book, to help gain awareness of how age causes certain areas of our life to be emphasized. For example, we generally are more emotional in our youth, more physically adept when we are in our prime, and as we enter our elder years, we have more wisdom than we have ever had before. These basic principles just scratch the surface of this ancient teaching. This lesson goes down into exponentially deeper levels, showing us what influences us at nine month intervals throughout our life up to the age of one hundred and eight, a sacred number in many cultures. Instead of simply seeing the season a forest is in, for example, we will be able to tell if it is early or late in the season and if there has been enough precipitation. Instead of simply seeing a picture of the Mona Lisa, we will be able to see the frame, her beautiful face, and every minute detail in the background. Instead of knowing we are traveling west in the United States on I-80 across Nebraska we will know exactly what mile marker we are near and where each business and house is along the way. Once we have this knowledge we can work with the influence our age provides.</span>  </p>
